# WordsManipulation

Program reads in a text file with all words (eg. dictionary) and gives users three options:
 1) Find all Palindromes that are greater than one character and saves it in a text file
 2) Finds the sum of the ASCII characters in a word, and saves only the first occurrence of the sum into a text file.
 3) All users to enter a string (at least three characters long), and find all words that contain that specific sequence
    and saves it into a text file.
    
 Each operation is timed and ran in their own thread.
