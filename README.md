# WordsManipulation

This program reads in a text file (words.txt) that contains a long list of words and provides users with three options:
 1) Creates a list of all palindromes in the file that are longer than one character and saves it in a text file (Palindromes.txt)
 2) Finds the sum of the ASCII value of all the characters for each word.  A list is created to save the first occurrence of the ASCII sum     into a text file (same.txt).
 3) Allow users to enter a string (at least three characters long), and create a list that contains all words with that sequence and saves     into a text file (substring.txt).
    
 Each operation is timed and ran in their own thread.
